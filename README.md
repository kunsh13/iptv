I have started C++ project on WIFI Embded Internet radio on MCU ESP32 WROOM + DAC VS1053b 24bit I2S audio processor, 3 Band eq. I would recommand [KaRadio32](https://github.com/karawin/Ka-Radio32) opensource library. I learned that WebStations are listed in a seperate file. I love how community religiously follow and experiment their projects. 

Later migrated the project to ESP32 WROVER-B and PCM5102 32Bit I2S audio processor. Having 8 MB SPI PSRAM and AAC/OGG for adding more stream audio over the https. Now there is no buffering of the audio. 

I am porting the project in LilyGo [TTGO TAudio](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50063&Id=1171). MCU ESP32 WROVER-B + DAC WM8978 I2S 24Bit 5 band eq.

As I kept learning I have added stream for video as well and created this iptv/internet radio project.
